# Brutalist Website
This is a static website, which features my latest design project about brutalism. It tries to follow recent trends and apply to the rules of web brutalism. The content was written with help of OpenAI as it is a new trend among the web developers. It was made for fun. It uses vite as its faster and more efficient.
